            <p>I am busy with a Software Engineering Bootcamp through Hyperion Dev. 
                I am working on my portfolio, upskilling myself and trying to gain 
                as much valuable experience as I possibly can before entering into
                the workforce and starting a brand new career in Software Development. 
               I come from a Beauty and IT Recruitment background which I believe has 
               given me a unique set of skills, such as patience, perseverance, communication, 
               innovation and working well under pressure. I have discovered my fierce love for 
               writing code and can honestly not imagine doing anything else for the rest of my life.
